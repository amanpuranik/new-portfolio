      If you're on this website right now, you may be a recruiter or a manager and you may be wondering who I am. My name is Aman! I'm a graduate from the University of Waterloo. Id like to reserve this section for a more personal look at who I am and talk about things that you otherwise wouldnt find on my resume. <br></br>
      I've always been interested in tech since I was a kid and by the time I got to my undergrad, I decided to do all my co-ops in software development, even though I didnt have an academic background in tech. This made entering the field much harder, however I was able to work hard and break into the field. It is because of this that I hold the value of hard work and discipline very close to me. I genuinely believe with these two things, there is no limit to what once can achieve. <br></br> Over the next few years, I was able to gain extensive knowledge on both frontend and backend devlopemt and was able to get familarized with a wide variety of tools. <br></br>
      I believe working at multiple different companies has forced me to "learn how to learn" since I would be working with new tech constantly and I believe knowing how to learn is an important trait for any software engineer. <br></br>
      Aside from my professional life, I'm also someone that loves to travel. Going forward in my 20s, I would like to place more empahsis on travel. Infact, the picture on the left is from my first solo trip, to the Netherlands! If I'm not behind my computer, you can also find me at the gym or at a basketball court.
